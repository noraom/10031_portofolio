                    Today we are going to play some banger tunes. 
                    But first we would like to remind you about some 
                    important things to remember during vacation. Did 
                    you know that there are some precautions you should take to take care of nature?</h2>

                    Part of this is about how we behave as tourists. There is some clear advice; Respect the nature you 
                    visit and the animals that live there. Take your trash home with you. Be careful not to damage the 
                    areas you visit in any way.</h2>

                <h2 class="palm-bubble">The temperature is rising due to human activity. 
                    If we neglect nature and do not take care of it, it can have catastrophic 
                    consequences. In addition to this, there are more and more fossil gases in 
                    the atmosphere. Together, this can result in plants dying and animals disappearing 
                    due to a bad climate and lack of clean water.</h2>

                <h2 class="palm-bubble">As global temperatures rise, many regions are experiencing longer 
                    dry seasons, which can increase the frequency and intensity of forest fires. In a situation 
                    like this, it is perhaps more important than ever that we take care of nature. 
                    Therefore, think twice if you visit an exposed area. </h2>

                    and for all it is as much your responsibility to take care of nature as anyone else!</h2>
