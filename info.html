        <h2>Reflection on portofolio</h2>
        <p>This is my portofolio for the exam in Advanced CSS. I Created this site with the intension of organizing the different obligatory assignments. My intension is to showcase the progress and development done to these sites. Hope you enjoy the experience!</p>

        <h3>Oblig 1</h3>
        <p>To the first oblig I have not done any changes to this oblig because I felt it did not need it, and to prioritize the other obligs because they are more important in this case. Its showcased in its original state under Oblig 1 on the portofolio page. I worked with Nora Storrø on this assignment.  I will therefore share my initial reflection and description. </p>
        <p>I implemented screenshot 2 in the assignment. I started by studying the assignment text. I downloaded Screenshot2 image to declare which elements I will use to build up the html structure. I then went to finn.no's log in page. Here I inspected the html structure to get a clue as to how the various elements are structured. I used photoshop to create a sketch of which elements I would use. </p>
        <p>I started by creating the html structure in page_screenshot2.html I wanted to have a clean, structured and correct html code. This will benefit me later in the coding. I used the BEM system to name my classes so that its easy to grab them in CSS. My HTML code is based on my own interpretation of existing elements and codes from finn.no's side, as well as the design elements that Nora and I created for the design system. I used some of the design system elements. The two Screenshot have many differences, therefore many of the elements only exist in one of the pages. So although we have used the same design system they do not have a lot in common. We found it the same way with the css. For the source to the pictures, i used the url i found the finn.no html code. </p>
        <p>My CSS file is mainly structured according to the left and right side. I have used BEM and Sass to make an efficient code. This makes it both easier to read and manipulate. I started with the most obvious things like the background being gray and the font having to be a sans serif. As described in the design system, I chose Arial. Then I focused on finishing the left side first. The left side is not made up of as many elements as the right, but also has two different boxes. There I filled in styles for the image and text. What took the longest was right__card. I spent some time making use of the correct css styles to shape the form and buttons. In the end, I think the result is like the original and I feel I have used BEM and sass well. I have learned a lot during this obligation, especially perhaps the most about Github. In github we only had small conflicts which we within the group were able to resolve on our own.</p>

        <h3>Oblig 2</h3>
        <p>We started by downloading the poster and using Adobe Illustrator to extract the svg elements. We used the svgomg to make the file smaller, and more readable. From there we added the code to our index.html, and ensured the right were right. Here we needed to rewrite some class names, so the rules didn't apply for any other svgs than themself. Then we implemented the design and layout with HTML and CSS, stating with implementing the 375px screen and later the larger screen. Some elements change in size, were it's natrual, others have the same sizes. The positioning might not 100% similar to the poster but is mostly the same. It's only small differences that does not take away the meaning of the poster</p>
        <p>All the animations are inspired by Lefties lecture about svg files, specific page 54- 68. We wanted the animations to feel natural and be coherent with the design. Therefore, we animated the extracted svg elements with their normal state (in the real world) in mind. Stars: have a Smil animation that transform them to rotate, this is done to simulate the flickering night sky with blinking and shifting stars. I also added a keyframe animation in css to animate the opacity. Together this makes them rotate and flicker, which we thought mimics a shining star in the sky. Moon: Here we added a Smil path animation to make the moon resemble rise and set. This path was made using a vertical path.</p>
        <p>Car: We wanted the car to feel like it floats in space. To act like it was taking off in zero gravity we added a path animations using Smil and made a curving path for the car to float and added «repeatCount=indefinite» to make it go on forever. Green figures: Because all the other animations were at the top of the poster, we wanted to even it out and make some of the bottom elements more interesting. Therefore, we added a @keyframe animation to css and made the green figures shake slightly. The figures resemble co2 clouds with angry faces and the shaking just made it even more clear that they are angry and not friendly. We think the animation succeeds to clarifying the message. The animations make the poster feel more alive and interesting. We think the animations contributes to emphasize the message.</p>
        <p>Here I think we had done a good job in the original submission. I worked on group with Viktoria Brodshaug Langaas on this assignment. The goal was to recreate the poster we were provided with in the assignment. Here we did add CSS in the case of styling, responsiveness and animations. The assignment had a list of things we had to incorporate into the CSS.  I think our original submission was close to what was expected in the assignment. Therefore, I only made minor alternations. We got some feedback, and after what I remember we missed CSS drawing in the original. I added one of the pupils of the eyes to the globe by CSS drawing. The live link version we originally delivered did not include the background, so I added that and made it responsive. The responsiveness is as I can get it within this time window. I also changed the animation of the moon by showing the overflow of the container, that way the moon did not disappear in the middle of the animation.  I tried to make some small adjustments to the text so that it would fit the globe a bit better and have better responsiveness. If I would have more time and resources, I would have worked on getting it more responsive and exact like the original poster provided. There are some differences like font style and a bit of positioning that is different, but overall, I am happy with the result!</p>
